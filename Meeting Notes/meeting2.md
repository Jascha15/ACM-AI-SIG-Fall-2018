# Meeting 2
- Ran through a basic git tutorial. If you want to learn more about git in your free time follow the listed instruction.
  - Clone the AI repo to your local machine (under GitHub user tylerthecoder)
  - Make a branch off of master
  - Add your name to the `members.md` file
  - commit your change and push it
  - make a pull request
  - I will accept it and merge it into master
- Added people as collaborators to the git repo
- Came up with a new plan for this semester
  - Original plan was to do one big project on one type of AI
  - New Plan: Every two weeks we do a mini project to show off multiple aspects of AI. Our Tentative projects are as follows
    - ChatBot
    - Image Recognition
    - Handwirtting Classifier
    - Genetic Algorithm
    - Min/Max Algorithm

- Adding new resource file with links to tutorials and other goodies. `helpfulResources.md`
