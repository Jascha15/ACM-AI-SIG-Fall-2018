## General Info About this SIG:

- Planning to meet 2 times a week - both meetings will be similar so no one is missing out if they can only attend one (meeting times are still being decided as we work out through everyone’s schedules)
  - Set meeting times for this semester will be decided by the end of this week (make sure to fill out the survey on GroupMe so we can get a good idea)
  - Meetings will revolve less around actual coding and more around bouncing ideas off of each other and asking questions if there are things about our project you don’t understand
    - We encourage you to try to learn and work on whatever project we end up doing outside of the meetings, because it will make a lot more sense if you can figure out the basics on your own (That said, don’t hesitate to ask questions if you have any :) )
- Planning to use GitHub as a central hub for code, questions, and meeting notes
  - Information on how to set up GitHub and join the repository above
  - We will begin transitioning lots of this over to GitHub after the first week or two and use the GroupMe for announcements and meeting reminders
- This SIG is for fun and we will try to advance your computer science skills as much as we can. That being said you’ll get as much out of it as you put into it, the more you look into different technologies and develop on your own, the better prepared you’ll be :)

## Meeting 1 Notes (9-10-18):
- Talked about artificial intelligence / machine learning in general and what we might want to do with it
- Collected several ideas about what projects people might be interested in working on
  - Planning to collect more at the Tuesday meeting and send out a poll by the end of the week to select a project to work on this semester
  - We are also planning to talk to some companies and professors about things they might want us to work on

## Next meeting:
- Decide what we want to do for the semester and come up with a list of technologies that we think would be useful.
- Everyone should do some general research on AI / Machine learning just to familiarize yourself with the concepts. (Googling “What is AI” is a good start) :)
